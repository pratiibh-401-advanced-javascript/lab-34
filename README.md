### Main Topic
Role based authorization

What problems do we need to solve for?

* What is the user authorized to do?
* Which parts of our application care about this?
* How can we determine this?
* What's in the token?
* Contact between the UI and the API
* How do we make this easy to use?

### Learning Objectives 
* Create a rules based application
* Authorize using both "Basic Authorization" and a "Bearer Token"
* Store a login token for re-use
* Hide and Show components, links, pages based on both login status and permissions

### Running the App
* npm start
